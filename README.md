# Assignment 3 - Sorting: Putting your affairs in order

This program uses series of individual c files, to implement different ways of
sorting arrays, numerically increasing, using the given algorithm codes in python.
Formulas that were used to sort the arrays were: Heap, Shell, Insert, and Quick sort.
Each of these algorithms had a different way of moving the elements of an array in their
specific order/indexes. 

# Building

To build and compile the program, Enter:

'''
$ make
'''

# Running 

To run the program:

'''
./sorting
'''
There would be further instructions on how to test the files inside
this file, As an example, it starts by giving a guideline as of how 
to run this program. It terminates the program and asks you to Enter
more instructions, such as ./sorting -a.
